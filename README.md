## Technology Stack
For this project, I intentionally focused on using native JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The objective behind this choice was to deepen my understanding and proficiency in these foundational web technologies. By avoiding the use of frameworks or libraries, I was able to gain a more thorough and nuanced grasp of:

- **HTML**: Structuring web content and layout with semantic and accessible markup.
- **CSS**: Styling the website with native CSS, practicing responsive design techniques and exploring advanced features like animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing interactivity and complex features using vanilla JavaScript, thereby solidifying my understanding of core JS concepts and browser APIs.

This approach allowed me to tackle challenges from the ground up, enhancing my problem-solving skills and providing a solid foundation for future learning and development in web technologies.
